**Extracting 50 RGB images of the baby's facial expressions from each video. Later, convert the 50 RGB images to gray scale images. So, you will be extracting totally 100 images from each video. You have been assigned with 3 videos i.e., video [28-30] in the dataset present under 'Nopain' folder which contains 13 videos.**

**GOAL**

To extract a total of 100 images i.e. 50 colored and 50 grayscale images from vid[28-30] and classify them into 3 folders(no-mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain), based on the facial expression of the newborn.


**PURPOSE**

My purpose was not only to achieve the mentioned goal, but also to learn along, and so I have prior knowledge on how to use OpenCV technique to extract images and then, implemented it in my code, then further worked on my code to make it better, and increase the time efficiency to be able to work on multiple files at the same time and extracted the images and classified them.


**DATASET**

[Dataset](https://livemissouristate-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nyc10040_missouristate_edu/Ev2GCLuXRK1DsgbeiRGRywkBBzLLqRH-OKaMi3rFHuM3iA?e=Zm3XcU)




**DESCRIPTION**

I read about How to extract images from multiple sources, you may refer to the references below and then implemented it in my code, to extract 50 images of both the types( colored as well as grayscale) for all 3 videos that I was assigned with.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**

First, you can refer my code files in Model folder to understand the code I have used(which is commented to make it easy to understand), then to see the Outcome of my approach, refer to Image Datasets folder and you can see the Colored and Grayscale images in different respective folders. My approach was to simply learn about how to use cv2 and other libraries for extracting image frames and then work on it.


**WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES**

Refer to compilation steps below, and go through the code. The final Image Datasets folder has images classified into folders based on Facial Expressions. My workflow has been - Learn, Code, Extract, Save images , and then convert those to grayscale and save those, and finally classify the images into different folders.


**STATE YOUR PROCEDURE AND UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR WORK**

I have prior knowledge how to use OpenCv and OS module, so it make my work easy, and on the other side, I have gone through personal blogs and notes for a better approach.


**DETAILED EXPLANATION OF SCRIPT, IF APPLICABLE**

My code files are added with comments to undrstand my approach.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- cv2
- os
- glob

**COMPILATION STEPS**

Import Libraries   
 > Read the video files from the folder they are saved in    
 > Extract image frames for each video    
 > Save them in a folder    
 > Then, convert these frames to grayscale    
 > Save them in a folder.


**RESEARCH**

I have prior knowledge of OpenCv, so I don't require to do any kind of research.


**SCREENSHOTS**

The images in the Image Dataset folder are the Output of my code.


**CONCLUSION**

The conclusion is that after implementing into my Code and then, classifying Images, the Dataset is ready to used with a model to save lives of many newborn babies which are at a very high-risk.
