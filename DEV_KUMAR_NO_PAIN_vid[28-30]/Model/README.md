## CODE FILES
---
The above two files contains piece of code which has been used to extract colored and grayscale images from the provived Video link. I have added comments in my code to make it easy for the reader to understand my approach.

My approaches is different for RGB and GRAYSCALE: 
- GRAYSCALE: When we have extract our RGB images, for each RGB image, we have created a grayscale image and push to the desired category

- RGB: For RGB images, we capture frames from images, and store in the RGB images folder, and later we have classify into its categories.
